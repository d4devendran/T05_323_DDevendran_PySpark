We have mainly two types of data types in python
1. Numeric
2. Boolean
3. String

1.Numeric:
	Numeric data types means numbers in the form of
A. Integer Ex: 2,5,6..etc
B. Float Ex: 2.3, 4.5 etc
C. Complex Ex: x+iy,a+ib
D. Long  # We are not using in Python 3.1.0

2. Boolean:
	This type of data type we can use for binary categorical values
Ex: True or False, Yes or No etc

3. String:
    String is a collection of characters. In python string are denoted double quotes or triple quotes.
Ex: "devendran","madhu"

Type Casting:
We can store integer values in int
	int x =5 or x= int(10)
Ex:
   2L litre capacity of watercan we can fill 2L of water

We can store float values in float
	float x=10.5 or x=float(7.5)
Ex:
    5L litre capacity of watercan we can fill 5L of water

We can store integer values in float. But memory will be wasted.
int to float: implicit casting
    float(10)
Ex:
    We can pour 2L water in 5L water can but space will remained

We can store float value in int but we lost some of the data
float to int: explicit casting
    Int(10.5)
Ex:
    We can pour 5L of water in 2L of watercan but water will overflows.

1. DATA TYPES IN PYTHON
    1.NUMBERS ---> python supports four different data types .
                   they are int,long,float,comolex

    2.STRING  ---> strings are amongst the most popular type in python.
                   we can create them simply enclosing charecters in quotes
                   python threats single quotes the same as double quotes.
    3.BOOLEAN --->

2.DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON
    list,tuple,dictionary and set

    list ----> list is a mutable data structure
               the list is a most versatile data type available in python which can be
               written as a list of comma separated values b/w square brackets

    tuple ----> tuple is immutable data structure
                tuples are sequences , just like lists

    dictionary----> dictionary is a mutable data structure
                    dictionary in python is an unorderd collection of data values

    set ----> a set is an unodered and mutable collection of unique elements

3. SEQUENCES IN PYTHON

    In Python programming, sequences are a generic term for an ordered set which means that the order in which
    we input the items will be the same when we access them.Python supports six different types of sequences.
    These are strings, lists, tuples, byte sequences, byte arrays, and range objects.

4. CRUD OPERATIONS

     The abbreviation CRUD expands to Create, Read, Update and Delete. These four are fundamental operations in a database.
     In the sample database, we will create it, and do some operations

                    GET is one of the most common HTTP method

     POST Method --> POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

     PUT Method --> PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

     HEAD Method --> HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.

     DELETE Method --> The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

     PACTH Method --> Patch is used to modify the capabilities

     OPTIONS Method --> The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

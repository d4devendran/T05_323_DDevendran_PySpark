2.== VS IS OPERATORS

      ==  : is for value equality. It's used to know if two objects have the same value.
            == is used for value comparison or content comparison or elements comparison.
      is  : is for reference equality. It's used to know if two references refer (or point) to the same object, i.e if they're identical.
            is is used for reference comparison.

3. / // % DIFFERENCES

    '/'  Division       --> Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and output in decimals
    '//' Floor Division	--> The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits
                            after the decimal point are removed.
                            But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away
                            from zero (towards negative infinity)
    '%' Modulus         --> It gives remainder value as a result

1. WHILE VS FOR

       While loop – This loop statement checks for a condition at the beginning and till the condition is 
                    fulfilled, it will execute the body of the loop.

       For loop   – For loops are used to sequentially iterate over a python sequence.
                    When the sequence has been iterated completely, the for loop ends and thus executes the 
                    next piece of code.

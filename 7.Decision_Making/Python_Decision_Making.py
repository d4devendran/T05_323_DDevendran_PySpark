Python Decision making:
 Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of programs and specifying actions were taken according to conditions

	1. Python Program Assumptions
        Decision Python programming language assumes any

        A.non-zero and not-None values as True, and if it either
        B.zero or None, then it is assumed as False value

  2. Types of Decision making:
       A.if
       B.if else
       C.if elif else
       D.Nested if
        
        
      A.if:
        Syntax:

        if(condition):
	          <statements>


        Ex:
		    a=19
	    	if(a==10):
			      print(“it is a correct value”)
          
       B.if else:
       Syntax:

       if(condition):
          <statements>
       else:
	        <statements>
       Ex:
        a=19
        if(a==10):
            print(“it is a correct value”)
	    	else:
            print(“it is not a correct value”)
         
        C.if elif else
        Syntax:
        if(condition):
            <statements>
        elif(condition):
            <statements>
        else:
		        <statements>


        Ex:
        a=19
        if(a==10):
            print(“it is a correct value”)
	      elif:
            print(“it is not a correct value”)
        else:
            print(“print correct value”)	
            
       D.Nested if
       Nested if is a “if” within a “if” we call it as Nested if
        Syntax:
	      if(condition):
		        <statements>
	      else(condition):
		        <statements>
		      if(condition):
			        <statements>
		      else(condition):
			        <statements>
